# ecosystem-collapse
Developed a machine learning model to predict ecosystem collapse risk based on structural features of food web networks. Leveraged graph theory and classical ML techniques to extract key network metrics and classify ecosystem stability. This project demonstrates how AI can support biodiversity conservation and ecological risk assessment.
